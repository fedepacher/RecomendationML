# <h1 align=center> **Movies Recomendation using Machine Learning** </h1>

## Introduction

A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the
users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts
the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.
